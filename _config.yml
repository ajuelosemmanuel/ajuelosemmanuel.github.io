  Hey ! I'm a computer science student at Sorbonne Universit√©. I'm currently working on... well, getting decent grades and sometimes on random projects in order to learn new things. Just in case, my github profile can be found [here](https://github.com/ajuelosemmanuel). I play videogames a lot, especially osu! ([my profile](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/1067183)) and I sometimes stream stuff on [twitch](https://www.twitch.tv/emmanuel_osu). I like hiking and reading too, but let's go back to more serious stuff.
