### "For fun" projects

[Loggers](https://github.com/ajuelosemmanuel/Loggers)

Loggers is a little bot that can gather every single message from a text channel on discord.

It can be used to save chats (by either creating txt files or writing everything in a new channel).

Another usage could be some "spying" on channels you can't read as a user : if your bot has more permissions than you, you may run this one with your bot's api key and then "read" the content of hidden channels.

[Feurs](https://github.com/ajuelosemmanuel/FeursBot)

Feurs is my first bot, and therefore I had no specific "goal" than experimenting with it.

Its main functionality is that he answers messages ending with "quoi" by "feur" (funny pun, right ?).

This aside, it can translate messages for a language to another and translate youtube videos. The other "functionalities" aren't that useful, those were really made for experimentation purposes.
