## About me

Hey ! I'm a computer science student at Sorbonne Universit√©. I'm currently working on... well, getting decent grades and sometimes on random projects in order to learn new things. I'm not really sure about what I wanna do in the future so I'm trying to keep as many "open doors" as possible. I plan on keeping this website up to date, at least until the end of this year.

I play videogames a lot, especially osu! ([my profile](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/10671830)) and I sometimes stream stuff on [twitch](https://www.twitch.tv/emmanuel_osu). I'm not really active at the moment tho.

I like hiking and reading too, but I can't really hike for now as I'm stuck at home since a year (like every student in France !).
